Since then I've been interested in creating projects and interacting with different frameworks,languages, or tools. I graduated college a year early so that I can have time to really understand and learn concepts deeply. It's always a great and rewarding feeling seeing something you envision come to life with just lines of codes, just like this website. When I'm not coding you can find me playing basketball with some friends. I grew up playing basketball and play now recreationally or sometimes competetivly in some men's leagues. Blockchain has also been something that has caught my eye. I like to read up on current topics surround the web3 world. Oh, and I'm also a big fan of video games and I'm always looking for some new recommandations so send them my way.",
